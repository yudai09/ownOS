// write
//     Write a character to a file.

//     `libc' subroutines will use this system routine for output to all files, 
//     including stdout---so if you need to generate any output, for example to a serial port for
//     debugging, you should make your minimal write capable of doing this. 

//     The following minimal implementation is an incomplete example; it relies on a writechar
//     subroutine (not shown; typically, you must write this in assembler from examples provided
//     by your hardware manufacturer) to actually perform the output.
int write(int file, char *ptr, int len){
  int todo;
      
  for (todo = 0; todo < len; todo++) {
    writechar(*ptr++);
  }
  return len;
}
